# Price Comparator

A Spring Boot application that imports product prices and discounts from CSV files, stores them in a database, and provides REST endpoints for shopping basket optimization, listing discounts, price alerts, price history, and recommendations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- **model/** ‚Äì JPA entities
- **repository/** ‚Äì Spring Data JPA repositories
- **service/** ‚Äì business logic for each functionality 
- **controller/** ‚Äì REST endpoints for handling client requests 
- **dto/** ‚Äì request and response objects used for communication between frontend and backend
- **config/** ‚Äì application configuration 
- **resources/** ‚Äì CSVs for test data, application config

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

To configure the database connection, the following environment variables must be defined and the database must be created:

```env
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/price_comparator
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=your_db_username
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
```

To enable email notifications for price alerts, also configure:

```env
SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```
**Note**: This email will be used as a sender for price alerts notifications.

./mvnw clean install

# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## ‚úÖ Assumptions & Simplifications

- CSV files are named in format `store_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` or `store_discounts_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- CSVs are uploaded via `POST /import/csv`
- Discount lines are ignored in the following cases:
   - The product does not exist in the database
   - A discount for the same product/store/date already exists
- Overlapping discounts are automatically handled as follows:
   - If a new discount is entirely inside an existing one, the old one is split into two parts
   - If a new discount fully matches an old one (same interval, different import date), the old one is replaced
   - If the new discount is completely outside and includes one or more old discounts, they are deleted
   - If the new discount overlaps at the beginning, the old one is truncated on the right
   - If the new discount overlaps at the end, the old one is truncated on the left
